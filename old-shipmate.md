Safe and sound at home again
let the waters roar jack
safe and sound at home again
let the waters roar jack

(chorus)
Long we've tossed on the rolling main
now we're safe ashore jack
dont forget your old shipmate
fal-dee ral-dee raldee raldee
rye-eye-oh

since we sailed from plymouth sound
four years gone or nigh, jack
were there ever chummies now
such as you and i jack

[chorus]

we have worked the self-same gun
quarterdeck division
sponger you and loader i
through the whole commission

[chorus]

often times have we laid out
toil nor danger fearing
tugging out a flapping sail
to a weather earring

[chorus]

there she sits and empty hulk
not a soul below now
number seven starboard mess
misses jack and joe now

[chorus]

but the best of friends must part
fair or foul the weather
hand your flipper for a shake
and a drink together

[chorus]
