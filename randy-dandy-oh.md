Now we are ready to head for the horn,
wey hey roll an' go
our boots and our clothes boys are all in the pawn,
to be rollicking randy dandy oh.

Heave a pall and heave away
wey hey roll an' go
the anchor's on board and the cables are stored
to be rollicking randy dandy oh.

Soon we'll be warping her out through the locks
wey hey roll an' go
the pretty young girls all come down in their frocks
to be rollicking randy dandy oh.

Man the stout capstan and heave with a will
wey hey roll an' go
Soon we'll be rolling her way down the hill
to be rollicking randy dandy oh.

Heave away bully, ye parish rigged bums
wey hey roll an' go
take your hands from your pockets and don't suck your thumbs
to be rollicking randy dandy oh.

Roust her up bullies the wind's drawing free
wey hey roll an' go
Let's get the glad rags on and drive her to sea
to be rollicking randy dandy oh.

We're outward bound for Valipo Bay
wey hey roll an' go
get crackin me lads its a hell of a way
to be rollicking randy dandy oh.
