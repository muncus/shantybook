Its time to go now,
Haul away your anchor
Haul away your anchor,
tis our sailing time

put some sail upon her
haul away your halyard
haul away your halyard
tis our sailing time

put her on her course now
haul away your foresheets
haul away your foresheets
tis our sailing time

waves are breaking under
haul away down channel
haul away down channel
on the evening tide

when my time is over
haul away for heaven
haul away for heaven
god be at my side
