Well, I'm sick in the head and i havent been to bed
since i first came ashore with me plunder
i've seen centipedes and snakes and my head is full of aches
and i have to walk the path to way up yonder

{: .chorus}
Its all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog
its all gone for beer and tobacco
well, i spent all me tin on the lasses drinking gin
and across the western ocean i must wander

Where are me boots, me noggin noggin boots
they're all gone for beer and tobacco
the sole is getting thin, and the upper's letting in
and the laces are holding out for better weather

where is me shirt, me noggin noggin shirt
its all gone for beer and tobacco
the buttons are worn out, the collar's torn about
and the tails are holding out for better weather
