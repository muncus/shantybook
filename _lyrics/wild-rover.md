I've been a wild rover for many's the year
and I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer

now i've return with gold in great store,
and never will play the wild rover no more

{: .chorus}
And it's no, nay, never! . . . .
no nay never no-more
will i play the wild rover
no never, no more.

i went into an alehouse i used to frequent
and i told the landlady my money was spent

i asked her for credit, she answered me "nay,
a patron like you i could have any day"

[chorus]

Then i pulled for my pocket ten sovereigns bright
and the landladys eyes opened wide with delight

she said "i have whiskeys and wines of the best
and the words that i told you were only in jest"

[chorus]

I go home to my parents, confess what i've done
and i'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son

and when they've forgave me as oft times before
i never will play the wild rover no more

[chorus]
