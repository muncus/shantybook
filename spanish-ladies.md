farewell and adieu to you spanish ladies
farewell and adieu to you ladies of spain

for we've received orders we're to sail for old england
and we may never see you fair ladies again

{: .chorus}
We'll rant and we'll roar, like true british sailors
we'll rant and we'll roar, across the salt sea
until we strike soundings in the channel of old england
from Ushant to Scilly is thirty five leagues.

We hove our ship to, with the wind from sou'west boys
we hove our ship to, for to take soundings clear
in fifty-five fathoms, with a fine sandy bottom
we squared our main yard and up channel did steer

[chorus]

the first land we made was a point called the Deadman
then Ram's Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland, and Wight
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairly and Dungeoness
and bore straight away for the South Foreland light

[chorus]

then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor
all in the Downs that night for to lie
so stand by your stoppers, see clear your shank painters
haul up your clew garnets, let tacks and sheets fly

[chorus]

let every man take off his full bumper
let every man drink off his full glass
we'll drink to be jolly and drown melancholy
and here's to the health of each true-hearted lass

[chorus]
