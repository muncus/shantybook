This site contains music and lyrics of traditional sea songs and shantys (or
chanteys). This is kept as a personal reference, and in the hopes that others
may also find it useful.

I've done my best to find sources for the music, where applicable. Pull Requests
are welcome if you'd like to add music or lyrics.
