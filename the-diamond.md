The Diamond is a ship me lads
for the Davis Strait she's bound
the quay it is all garnished
with bonnie lasses round

Captain Thompson gives the order
to sail the ocean wide
where the sun it never sets, me boys
nor darkness dims the sky

{: .chorus}
And its cheer up me lads
let your hearts never fail
while the bonny ship the Diamond
goes a-fishing for the whale

Along the quay at Peterhead
the lasses gather round
their shawls all pulled about them
and their salt tears running down

Oh don't you cry, my bonny lass,
though you be left behind,
For the rose will bloom on Greenland's ice
before we change our mind

[chorus]

a health to the Resolution
likewise the Eliza Swan
a health to the Battler of Montrose
and the Diamond ship of fame

we wear the trousers of the white
the jackets of the blue
when we return to Peterhead
we'll have sweethearts anew

[chorus]

It'll be bright both day and night
when the Greenland lads come home
with a ship thats full of oil me boys
and money to our name

we'll make the cradles for to rock
the blankets for to tear
and every lass in Peterhead sing
"Hushabye my dear"

[chorus]
