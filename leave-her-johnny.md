There are lots of possible verses for this one. this is not a complete list.

Oh the work was hard and the wages low
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
The seas ran high and the winds did blow
And its time for us to leave her.

{: .chorus}
Leave her Johnny Leave her
Oh, leave her Johnny leave her
for the voyage is done, and the winds dont blow
and its time for us to leave her

i thought i hear the old man say
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
tomorrow you will get your pay
And its time for us to leave her.

the winds were foul and the seas ran high
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
we shipped it green and none went by
And its time for us to leave her.

i hate to sail on this rotten tub
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
no grog allowed and rotten grub
And its time for us to leave her.

the starboard pump is like the crew
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
she's all worn out and will not do
And its time for us to leave her.

the mate is a bastard and the old man worse
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
they'll knock you over with a spit and curse
And its time for us to leave her.
